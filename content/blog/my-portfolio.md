If you're are only here for the code then feel free to [check it out on Github](https://github.com/saiba-tenpura/portfolio).

As for the technologies used in this project:
* [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) a Vue based Full Stack framework.
  * [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module for managing the markdown based blog entries.
  * [Nuxt Image](https://image.nuxtjs.org/) module for handling image optimizations.
  * [Nuxt Color Mode](https://color-mode.nuxtjs.org/) module for handling light & dark mode switching.
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) a utility-first CSS framework.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as icon library.

I continously work on the portfolio to improve it bit by bit. Thus in order to save me the hassle of publishing every change myself I utilise Github Action workflows to automatically build and publish it on every commit. Since the portfolio basically only consists of static files I also use the Static Site Generation (SSG) of Nuxt to increase performance.

Rough content ideas:
* Describe the logo design process.
* Continous improvement.
