If you're are only here for the code then feel free to have [check it out on Github](https://github.com/saiba-tenpura/portfolio). The technical aspects and features can be found in the repositories README.

Rough content ideas:
* Tell the reader that most of it is already in the README of the repository.
* Describe the logo design process.
* Continous improvement.
* Link to the portfolio on Github.
