Most of the technical aspects are already outlined in the repositories README, so if you're only here for that then go ahead and take a look for yourself.

Rough content ideas:
* Tell the reader that most of it is already in the README of the repository.
* Give a short summary of the used technologies anyway.
* Describe the logo design process.
* Continous improvement.
* Link to the portfolio on Github.
