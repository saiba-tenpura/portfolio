I first knowingly came into contact with Linux during my vocational training about :YearsSince{:year=2015} years ago. That was also about the same time Windows 10 was released and if you experienced it for yourself you remember that it had quite a few issues in the beginning to say the least. My personal gripes with it at the time included that it installed random software without my consent and after a reinstall of what I thought was a bricked Windows system I found out that deactivating Cortana was the very reason my system had been bricked in the first place.As a user these sour experiences ultimatetly lead me to the decision to give Linux a shot.

At first I decided to play it safe and dual booted Windows and Linux but I quickly discovered that Linux was very well able to cover most of my day to day use cases without much of a hitch. So from that point onward I decided to use Linux as my main personal OS. After learning more and more about Linux I at some point discovered the Linux ricing community. Here is the definition for anybody who isn't familiar with the term.

> **Rice** is a word that is commonly used to refer to making visual improvements and customizations on one's desktop. It was inherited from the practice of customizing cheap Asian import cars to make them appear to be faster than they actually were - which was also known as **ricing**.

Rough content ideas:
* [X] &nbsp; Linux only user for more than 7 years.
* Why I stopped using Windows.
  * [X] &nbsp; Forced updates, software.
  * [X] &nbsp; No control over own OS. (Mention Cortana incident?)
* Started dual booting Pop!_OS.
  * [X] &nbsp; Never really looked back.
* Discovery of Linux Ricing.
  * [X] &nbsp; Short definition of ricing.
  * Getting Started with that.
  * Switching from Xorg to Wayland.
* Downsides.
  * Game/Software Support.
  * Endless customization / time sink.
  * You are responsible if something breaks.
* Upsides.
  * Great learning opportunity.
  * Freedom.
* Plans for the future.
  * Also move desktop to wayland.
