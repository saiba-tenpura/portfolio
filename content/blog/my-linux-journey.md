Rough content ideas:
* Linux only user for more than 7 years.
* Why I stopped using Windows.
  * Forced updates.
  * No control over own OS. (Mention Cortana incident?)
* Started dual booting Pop!_OS.
  * Never really looked back.
* Discovery of Linux Ricing.
  * Short definition of ricing.
  * Getting Started with that.
  * Switching from Xorg to Wayland.
* Downsides.
  * Game/Software Support.
  * Endless customization / time sink.
  * You are responsible if something breaks.
* Upsides.
  * Great learning opportunity.
  * Freedom.
* Plans for the future.
  * Also move desktop to wayland.
