I first knowingly came into contact with Linux during my vocational training about :YearsSince{year=2015} years ago. That was also about the same time Windows 10 was released and if you experienced it for yourself you remember that it had quite a few issues in the beginning to say the least.

My personal gripes with it at the time included that it installed random software without my consent and after a reinstall of what I thought was a bricked Windows system I found out that the deactivation of Cortana was the very reason my system was bricked in the first place. As a user these sour experiences lead me to the decision to give Linux a shot.

Rough content ideas:
* [X] &nbsp; Linux only user for more than 7 years.
* Why I stopped using Windows.
  * [X] &nbsp; Forced updates, software.
  * [X] &nbsp; No control over own OS. (Mention Cortana incident?)
* Started dual booting Pop!_OS.
  * Never really looked back.
* Discovery of Linux Ricing.
  * Short definition of ricing.
  * Getting Started with that.
  * Switching from Xorg to Wayland.
* Downsides.
  * Game/Software Support.
  * Endless customization / time sink.
  * You are responsible if something breaks.
* Upsides.
  * Great learning opportunity.
  * Freedom.
* Plans for the future.
  * Also move desktop to wayland.
