Back in the day I learned about the Guilty Gear Games and was intrigued by their unique shading techniques so I wanted to try it for myself. Coincidentally one of my friends just had recently started to play VRChat because of that I decided to kill two birds with one stone and create a custom avatar for him. I ultimately settled on recreating Spooky Boogie from the Psycho-Pass series not only because said friend is a big fan of the series but also because the character itself actually serves as an VR avatar.

Draft:
* Why this character in particular?
  * Character in the Psycho-Pass series.
  * In the series itself it serves as an VR avatar.
  * Friend is huge fan of the Psycho-Pass series and a VRChat Player.
  * A great oppurtunity to try out and learn a bunch of technologies and ideas.
    * Special shader and lighting.
    * Rigging.
    * Creating a 3D-Model for a unique character concept.
    * Weight Painting.
    * Using the Unity Game Engine.
* Process for the separate technologies.
  * Bones for rigging were basically predefined by VRChat.
  * Special shader for using ILM map like in Guilty Gear games to create anime like shading.
* Link to VRChat download.
