Back in the day I learned of the Guilty Gear games and was intrigued by their unique 3D shading techniques so I wanted to use it in one of my own projects. Coincidentally one of my friends just had recently started to play VRChat and because of that I decided to kill two birds with one stone and create a custom avatar for him. I ultimately settled on recreating Spooky Boogie from the Psycho-Pass series not only because said friend is a big fan of the series but also because the character itself actually serves as an VR avatar.

Let's first talk about what makes the Guilty Gear games special since you might not be familiar with them. When the series first launched it was actually a 2D game but when they made the jump to 3D they faced the challenge of having to translate their hand drawn anime like style into an environment where lighting is usually based on physics and the viewpoint is not fixed to one angle. In order to tackle these challgendes and successfully achieve the transition they had to develop a couple of new techniques.



Draft:
* Why this character in particular?
  * Character in the Psycho-Pass series.
  * In the series itself it serves as an VR avatar.
  * Friend is huge fan of the Psycho-Pass series and a VRChat Player.
  * A great oppurtunity to try out and learn a bunch of technologies and ideas.
    * Special shader and lighting.
    * Rigging.
    * Creating a 3D-Model for a unique character concept.
    * Weight Painting.
    * Using the Unity Game Engine.
* Process for the separate technologies.
  * Bones for rigging were basically predefined by VRChat.
  * Special shader for using ILM map like in Guilty Gear games to create anime like shading.
* Link to VRChat download.
